# npm Enterprise Add-Ons

Add-ons allow third-party developer tools to integrate directly into npm Enterprise.
This allows npm Enterprise to be augmented with powerful functionality, such as: vulnerability scanning, license auditing, and code quality analysis.

## Installing Add-Ons

Add-ons are installed via the `npme` admin tool on your Enterprise server:

1. ssh into your npme appliance.
2. run `npme addon <add-on-identifier>`.
3. _third-parties may require an additional step, such as verifying your
   email address._
4. that's all there is to it, visit the npm Enterprise website to
   view the newly installed add-on:

## Add-Ons Currently Available

### Node Security

* homepage: https://nodesecurity.io/
* installation: `npme addon nodesecurity`

The Node Security team audits modules Enterprises depend on and then surface this  security information in the Node Security Platform. For years, the nsp tool has been a pivotal source of intelligence on vulnerabilities in Node dependencies.

The npm Enterprise Node Security add-on provides this information in the sidebar of the module detail page. By clicking the sidebar, a user receives a more detailed
description of the vulnerability.

### FOSSA

* homepage: http://fossa.io/
* installation: `npme addon http://{fossa_host}/api/services/npm`

FOSSA’s Licenses add-on proactively assesses both public and proprietary packages in a company’s npmE registry to identify licensing issues and obligations. npmE users will be able to view an at-a-glance summary of a package’s licensing impact online before deciding to download and integrate into their products.

FOSSA runs as an appliance securely behind your firewall, contact
support@fossa.io to get started with this add-on.

### bitHound

* homepage: https://www.bithound.io/
* installation: `npme install addon https://www.bithound.io/npm/plugin.json`

Once the bitHound Addon is activated (via email post installation), you will start seeing bitHound package metrics and insights. This will show up on the right hand side where you're already used to seeing npm provided information.

This information provides valuable insight into the health of the open-source
dependencies your company is building on top of.

## Writing Your Own Add-On

Would you like to write an npm Enterprise add-on? send an email to
<a href="mailto:support@npmjs.com">support@npmjs.com</a>.

npm Enterprise Add-Ons consist of two parts: a manifest that provides
meta information about an add-on, and a server that gets web-hooks
posted to it from the npm Enterprise appliance.

### The Manifest

The manifest contains the following fields:

* **type:** what type of add-on is this (currently `badge plus` is the only option)
* **email:** email address of the add-on maintainer.
* **name:** human readable name for add-on.
* **homepage:** homepage URL for add-on.
* **description:** a brief description of the add-on.
* **callback:** callback to invoke during add-on installation.
* **webhook:** webhook to invoke with package.json, as package pages are
  visited by users.

_bitHound's manifest:_

     {
       "type": "badge plus",
       "email": "gord@bithound.io",
       "name": "Package Metrics",
       "homepage": "https://www.bithound.io",
       "description": "Package Metrics powered by bitHound",
       "callback": "https://www.bithound.io/auth/npm",
       "webhook": "https://www.bithound.io/webhook/npm"
     }

The manifest should be available on a public URL, and is installed via:

     npme addon https://manifest-url

### The Server

The server component listens for events posted to the `webhook` and
`callback` URL described in the manifest.

The `callback` URL receives `access_token` and `email`, the `access_token`
is used to sign future webhooks, using a signing scheme outlined [here](https://github.com/bcoe/npm-tonic-app/blob/master/server.js#L94).

The `webhook` URL is posted a signed payload, representing the package
page that a user is viewing. A webhook returns a payload representing
the UI elements that should be rendered on the package page.

_sample response:_

     {
         "rows": [
         {
           "image": {
           "text": "",
           "url": "http://localhost:8081/static/images/tonicdev.ico"
         },
         "link": {
            "url": "https://tonicdev.com/npm/nyc",
            "text": "test nyc in the browser"
         }
        }
      ]
     }

Two sample servers are available as a point of reference:

* **name:** npm Top Users
* **code:** https://github.com/bcoe/top-npm-users-server

Displays a list of the top npm users contributing to a package,
based on their download counts.

* **name:** Tonic
* **code:** https://github.com/bcoe/npm-tonic-app

Experiment with an npm module using Tonic.
